# What is Scigic

Scigic is a Browser + Assistant aimed at being a single point of contact for all your digital interactions

## Features

#### Modes of interaction
- Manual
- Assisted

#### Unified Search and Command Interface
- Just like the 'spotlight search', there's a single ask bar where users input queries or commands. Depending on the context, Scigic decides the best action - conducting a web search (manual) or getting assistance (assisted).
  
#### Web Apps at Your Fingertips:
- Open any web app in scigic and access it like 'spotlight search', streamlining your workflow and boosting productivity. You can clip multiple web apps to home screen for more quicker and easy access.
  
#### Tabs Revolutionized to Slates
- Slates are auto-managed by Scigic.
- Slates incorporates a dynamic interface providing scigic to express itself and load third party web apps and interfaces
- A more intuitive way to navigate between slates "Vertical Slate Switcher"

## Shortcuts

- Option + Space to call Scigic (you can customize this from settings)
- ` (Backtick) to bring up the Home view
- Command + J to navigate one slate above
- Command + K to navigate one slate below
- Command + \ (backslash) to close current slate
- Command + P to open iCloud Keychain (saved passwords)
- Shift + enter to add a new line in the Ask Bar
- Command + enter to search Google manually


## Things on hold that were tested in private alpha

### Third Mode: Autonomous

#### Seamless Task Execution

- Beyond mere suggestions, the assistant can take direct actions for users, such as sending or summarizing emails, slack messages, scheduling reminders.
- Basically assigning tasks to Scigic. Becoming autonomous...


#### Problem with this mode

- It looks cool and is fun to watch or play with it occasionally but we didn't feel anyone would want to integrate this into their workflow or has an immediate need for it. 
- If any of you think otherwise please reach us to our twitter (X) handle and maybe we'll add you to waitlist for alpha testing. Look at the attached video to see it sending and summarizing email.
