# What is Scigic

Scigic is a Browser + Assistant aimed at being a single point of contact for all your digital interactions

<br>

# Features

#### Modes of interaction
- Manual
- Assisted
  
<br>

#### Unified Search and Command Interface
- There's a single ask bar where users input queries or commands. Depending on the context, Scigic decides the best action - conducting a web search (manual) or gives a direct response or assistance (assisted)

<br>
  
#### Scigic at Your Fingertips:
- Scigic can be opened from anywhere on the computer like 'spotlight search'
- Load any web app in scigic and make it accessible to streamline your workflow and boost productivity. No need to move back and forth between multiple windows
- You can clip multiple web apps to home screen for more quicker and easy access

<br>
  
#### Tabs Revolutionized to Slates
- Slates are auto-managed by Scigic
- Slates incorporates a dynamic interface providing scigic to express itself and load third party web apps and interfaces
- A more intuitive way to navigate between slates "Vertical Slate Switcher"

<br>

## Things on hold that were tested in private alpha

### Third Mode is Autonomous

#### Seamless Task Execution

- Beyond mere suggestions, the assistant can take direct actions for users, such as sending or summarizing emails, slack messages, scheduling reminders.
- Basically assigning tasks to Scigic. Becoming autonomous...

<br>

#### Problem with this mode

- It looks cool and is fun to watch or play with it occasionally but we didn't feel anyone would want to integrate this into their workflow or has an immediate need for it. 
- If any of you think otherwise please reach us to our twitter (X) handle and maybe we'll add you to waitlist for alpha testing. Look at the attached video to see it sending and summarizing email.
